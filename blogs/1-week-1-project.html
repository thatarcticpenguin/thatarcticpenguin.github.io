        <h1>1W1P — One Week, One Project</h1>
<p>I’m good at <em>starting</em> things.<br>
I’m much worse at actually finishing them.</p>
<p>Courses, playlists, “learn X in 7 days” plans — I’ve tried a lot of them.<br>
They all felt productive, but when I looked back, there was very little I could actually point to and say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I built this. It works.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1W1P is my way of forcing that to change.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why This Exists</h2>
<p>The problem isn’t <em>resources</em>.<br>
The internet is overflowing with tutorials, roadmaps, and “ultimate guides”.</p>
<p>The real problems are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>infinite scope</strong></li>
<li><strong>no clear finish line</strong></li>
<li><strong>no pressure to ship anything</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Watching videos feels like progress.<br>
Reading docs feels like progress.<br>
But progress only becomes real when something <strong>runs on a real machine</strong> and <strong>survives a fresh setup</strong>.</p>
<p>1W1P exists to bake one rule into my brain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Finish. Then move on.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>The Core Idea 🎯</h2>
<p><strong>1W1P = One Week, One Project.</strong></p>
<p>Simple rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every week has <strong>one main goal</strong></li>
<li>That goal must become <strong>one working project</strong></li>
<li>No “I’ll clean it up later”</li>
<li>No saving half-done stuff for some mythical free weekend</li>
</ul>
<p>Each week is a small box:</p>
<ul>
<li>You start</li>
<li>You struggle</li>
<li>You ship</li>
<li>You close the box and open a new one</li>
</ul>
<p>The point is not perfection.<br>
The point is momentum. ⚡</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why Turn It Into a Game? 🎮</h2>
<p>Discipline is cool in theory.<br>
In practice, it’s unreliable.</p>
<p>Games work because they have:</p>
<ul>
<li>rules</li>
<li>constraints</li>
<li>penalties</li>
<li>visible state</li>
</ul>
<p>So I’m treating this like a <strong>game</strong>, not a productivity ritual.</p>
<p>There are hearts ❤️ (think Minecraft health bar vibes).<br>
There are failures.<br>
There is progression.<br>
And there <em>is</em> an end state.</p>
<p>The goal is to let the rules decide — not my mood, not my energy, not “I’ll do it tomorrow”.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Game Rules 📜</h2>
<h3>Progression ⏫</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each week = <strong>one project</strong></li>
<li>I can’t start Week N+1 until Week N actually ships</li>
<li>“Complete” means it runs from a <strong>clean clone or fresh install</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If it doesn’t run, it doesn’t count.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Failure &amp; Hearts ❤️</h3>
<ul>
<li>Missing a weekly deadline costs <strong>one heart</strong> ❤️</li>
<li>Hearts are finite (no creative mode here)</li>
<li>Lose all hearts → the challenge ends 💀</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn’t about punishment.<br>
It’s about making time and drift <strong>impossible to ignore</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Shipping 🚢</h3>
<p>A project is considered <em>done</em> only if:</p>
<ul>
<li>it runs from a fresh setup</li>
<li>basic usage is documented (even minimally)</li>
<li>errors are handled on purpose, not just ignored</li>
</ul>
<p>Ugly code is allowed. 💻<br>
Broken code is not.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Scope Control ✂️</h3>
<ul>
<li>If I’m stuck on one problem for too long, I must reduce scope</li>
<li>Cutting features is always allowed</li>
<li>Skipping the week is not</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is to <strong>finish something</strong>, not everything I originally imagined.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Learning 🧠</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tutorials are allowed, but only to unblock understanding</li>
<li>The final implementation must be written by me</li>
<li>If I can’t explain what a piece of code does, I don’t “own” it yet</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning is measured by what I can <strong>rebuild from scratch</strong>, not by what I’ve watched.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Time ⏰</h3>
<ul>
<li>Every day needs at least a tiny touch — even 5 minutes</li>
<li>Small progress still counts</li>
<li>Full zero days break the chain</li>
</ul>
<p>Consistency beats intensity.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Reflection 🪞</h3>
<p>At the end of each week, I’ll write a short reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li>what worked</li>
<li>what broke</li>
<li>what was confusing</li>
<li>what I’d do differently next time</li>
</ul>
<p>No essays. Just honest notes.<br>
That’s how mistakes slowly turn into instincts.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What I’ll Be Building 🧩</h2>
<p>The challenge is broken into phases.<br>
Each one leans a little deeper into systems and complexity.</p>
<p>Roughly, it will move through:</p>
<ul>
<li>small scripts and tools</li>
<li>talking to the operating system</li>
<li>building simple interfaces and APIs</li>
<li>adding scheduling and persistence</li>
<li>poking into lower-level behavior</li>
<li>then stitching everything together into something bigger</li>
</ul>
<p>Each week should feel slightly uncomfortable but still finishable.<br>
Nothing here is meant to be filler.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What This Is <em>Not</em> 🚫</h2>
<p>This is <strong>not</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>a speedrun</li>
<li>a playlist of random tutorials</li>
<li>a portfolio flex</li>
<li>a perfection contest</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a finishing challenge.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Real Goal 🏁</h2>
<p>The real outcome isn’t “X projects built”.<br>
It’s building:</p>
<ul>
<li>comfort with not knowing everything at the start</li>
<li>confidence to begin from an empty folder</li>
<li>the ability to debug without panicking</li>
<li>the habit of shipping under constraints</li>
</ul>
<p>If those improve, the game is doing its job.<br>
Everything else is a bonus.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Closing 🔚</h2>
<p>This whole thing is an experiment.<br>
The rules might change. The projects will definitely change.</p>
<p>But one part is non‑negotiable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every week ends with something that actually exists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No infinite drafts.<br>
No “someday”.</p>
<p>Just one week.<br>
One project.<br>
Again and again. ♻️</p>
