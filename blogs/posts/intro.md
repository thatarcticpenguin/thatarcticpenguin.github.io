Hey, I’m **Penguin**.

I’m a first-year uni student who likes building things\. Most days I’m somewhere between writing code, and redesigning my site for the 17th time.

I’m not an expert. I’m not pretending to be one either.

## What I do

Mostly:
- write Python (and slowly get better at it)
- mess around with Linux (Arch btw)
- build small tools, scripts, and side projects
- learn by actually making stuff instead of just watching videos

I enjoy:
- minimal, dark UIs
- terminal aesthetics
- systems that feel *clean*
- projects that start simple and grow naturally

## Why this blog exists

I forget things fast... like, really fast.

Writing helps me:
- document whatever the fk i do
- look back later and cringe (important part)
- pass my time writing and maintaining this shit

This blog is basically a diary to me.
And you as a reader, wont get bored (hopefully).

## What you’ll find here

Expect posts about:
- programming stuff I’m learning
- problems I ran into and how I fixed them
- random dev thoughts
- vent (95% of the time)
- small projects and experiments
- absolute holy yap

Some posts will be polished.  
Some won’t. That’s fine. After all, it's just a process.

If it seems like you have seen this site somewhere, that's just coz i copied most designs into one, thanks to [namishh](https://github.com/namishh), [magicalcat](https://github.com/thatmagicalcat), and [quantinium](https://github.com/quantinium3) for the designs.
