# 1W1P — One Week, One Project

I’m good at *starting* things.  
I’m much worse at actually finishing them.

Courses, playlists, “learn X in 7 days” plans — I’ve tried a lot of them.  
They all felt productive, but when I looked back, there was very little I could actually point to and say:

> “I built this. It works.”

1W1P is my way of forcing that to change.

---

## Why This Exists

The problem isn’t *resources*.  
The internet is overflowing with tutorials, roadmaps, and “ultimate guides”.

The real problems are:
- **infinite scope**
- **no clear finish line**
- **no pressure to ship anything**

Watching videos feels like progress.  
Reading docs feels like progress.  
But progress only becomes real when something **runs on a real machine** and **survives a fresh setup**.

1W1P exists to bake one rule into my brain:

> **Finish. Then move on.**

---

## The Core Idea 🎯

**1W1P = One Week, One Project.** 

Simple rules:
- Every week has **one main goal**
- That goal must become **one working project**
- No “I’ll clean it up later”
- No saving half-done stuff for some mythical free weekend

Each week is a small box:
- You start
- You struggle
- You ship
- You close the box and open a new one

The point is not perfection.  
The point is momentum. ⚡

## Why Turn It Into a Game? 🎮

Discipline is cool in theory.  
In practice, it’s unreliable.

Games work because they have:
- rules
- constraints
- penalties
- visible state

So I’m treating this like a **game**, not a productivity ritual.

There are hearts ❤️ (think Minecraft health bar vibes).  
There are failures.  
There is progression.  
And there *is* an end state.

The goal is to let the rules decide — not my mood, not my energy, not “I’ll do it tomorrow”.

---

## The Game Rules 📜

### Progression ⏫
- Each week = **one project**
- I can’t start Week N+1 until Week N actually ships
- “Complete” means it runs from a **clean clone or fresh install**

If it doesn’t run, it doesn’t count.

---

### Failure & Hearts ❤️
- Missing a weekly deadline costs **one heart** ❤️
- Hearts are finite (no creative mode here)
- Lose all hearts → the challenge ends 💀

This isn’t about punishment.  
It’s about making time and drift **impossible to ignore**.

---

### Shipping 🚢

A project is considered *done* only if:
- it runs from a fresh setup
- basic usage is documented (even minimally)
- errors are handled on purpose, not just ignored

Ugly code is allowed. 💻  
Broken code is not.

---

### Scope Control ✂️

- If I’m stuck on one problem for too long, I must reduce scope  
- Cutting features is always allowed  
- Skipping the week is not

The goal is to **finish something**, not everything I originally imagined.

---

### Learning 🧠

- Tutorials are allowed, but only to unblock understanding  
- The final implementation must be written by me  
- If I can’t explain what a piece of code does, I don’t “own” it yet

Learning is measured by what I can **rebuild from scratch**, not by what I’ve watched.

---

### Time ⏰

- Every day needs at least a tiny touch — even 5 minutes  
- Small progress still counts  
- Full zero days break the chain

Consistency beats intensity.

---

### Reflection 🪞

At the end of each week, I’ll write a short reflection:
- what worked
- what broke
- what was confusing
- what I’d do differently next time

No essays. Just honest notes.  
That’s how mistakes slowly turn into instincts.

---

## What I’ll Be Building 🧩

The challenge is broken into phases.  
Each one leans a little deeper into systems and complexity.

Roughly, it will move through:
- small scripts and tools
- talking to the operating system
- building simple interfaces and APIs
- adding scheduling and persistence
- poking into lower-level behavior
- then stitching everything together into something bigger

Each week should feel slightly uncomfortable but still finishable.  
Nothing here is meant to be filler.

---

## What This Is *Not* 🚫

This is **not**:
- a speedrun  
- a playlist of random tutorials  
- a portfolio flex  
- a perfection contest  

It’s a finishing challenge.

---

## The Real Goal 🏁

The real outcome isn’t “X projects built”.  
It’s building:
- comfort with not knowing everything at the start
- confidence to begin from an empty folder
- the ability to debug without panicking
- the habit of shipping under constraints

If those improve, the game is doing its job.  
Everything else is a bonus.

---

## Closing 🔚

This whole thing is an experiment.  
The rules might change. The projects will definitely change.

But one part is non‑negotiable:

> Every week ends with something that actually exists.

No infinite drafts.  
No “someday”.  

Just one week.  
One project.  
Again and again. ♻️
